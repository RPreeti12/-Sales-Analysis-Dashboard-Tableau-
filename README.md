# -Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-Tableau-
I have built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze sales performance across different regions, categories, and time periods. The goal was to help business stakeholders quickly identify high performing areas, declining trends, and key revenue drivers. The dataset was simulated to reflect realistic sales metrics.
 ##Data set used:
 - <a href-"https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls">Dataset</a>
   
##Questions (KPIs)
-What are the total sales and profit this year?
-Which region is performing the best in terms of sales?
-What is the average discount and quantity sold by category?
-How are monthly sales trending over time?
-Which sub-categories are underperforming despite high sales volume?
-Are discounts hurting or helping profit margins?
